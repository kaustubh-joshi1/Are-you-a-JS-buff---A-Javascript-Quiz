# Are-you-a-JS-buff---A-Javascript-Quiz
This quiz includes questions testing basic knowledge of Javascript.
I have used `readlineSync` and `chalk` NPM pacakges for this CLI app.
I have made the quiz level based. It allows you to proceed to next level only if you answer 1 or more question right from the 2 questions in the level.
Have used `mutlti option` feature of readlineSync.
